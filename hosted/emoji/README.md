## What are these files for?
You can use these files in this Tusky-Fork if you place one of them at `/storage/emulated/0/NotoColorEmojiCompat.ttf`.  
- `TwemojiCompat.ttf` is a [Twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji)-based font which might use Blobmoji as a fallback (and in some other cases as this is a weird modificated version of Blobmoji with some images replaced by their Twemoji-version)
- `BlobmojiCompat.ttf` is a [Blobmoji](https://github.com/c1710/blobmoji)-based font which is an updated fork of the beloved Blob-emojis.
